<title>Example of moving a log manually</title>
<shortdesc>If you want to move the log to <codeph>g:/bigdisk/tourslog</codeph>,
move the log with operating system commands.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<refbody>
<section><p>For example, you could use the following command:</p></section>
<example>
<codeblock><b>move h:\janets\tourslog\log\*.* g:\bigdisk\tourslog\log</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>Then, alter the <codeph>logDevice</codeph> entry in
<codeph>service.properties</codeph> to read as follows:</p></section>
<example>
<codeblock>logDevice=g:/bigdisk/toursLog</codeblock></example>
<section>
<note>You can use either a single forward slash or double back slashes
for a path separator.</note></section>
<section><p>If you later want to move the log back to its default location (in
this case, <codeph>d:\mydatabases\toursDB\log</codeph>), move the log manually
as follows:</p></section>
<example>
<codeblock><b>move g:\bigdisk\tourslog\log\*.* d:\mydatabases\toursDB\log</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>Then, delete the <codeph>logDevice</codeph> entry from
<codeph>service.properties</codeph>.</p></section>
<section>
<note>This example uses commands that are specific to the Windows operating
system. Use commands appropriate to your operating system to copy a directory
and all of its contents to a new location.</note></section>
