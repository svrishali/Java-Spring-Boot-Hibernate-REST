<title>Managing the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
Network Server remotely by using the servlet interface</title>
<shortdesc>You can use the servlet interface to manage the Network Server
remotely. To use the servlet interface, the servlet must be registered with
an Application Server, and <codeph>derby.system.home</codeph> must be known to
the Application Server.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p><note type="important">The servlet interface is suitable only for testing
purposes. It should not be used in production.</note></p>
<p>A web application archive (WAR) file for the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server,
<codeph>derby.war</codeph>, is available in
<codeph>$<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>/lib</codeph>.
This file registers the Network Server's servlet at the relative path
<codeph>/derbynet</codeph>. See the documentation for your Application Server
for instructions on how to install it.</p>
<p>For example, if <codeph>derby.war</codeph> is installed in WebSphere
Application Server with a context root of <codeph>derby</codeph>, the URL of the
server is:</p>
<codeblock>http://&lt;server>[:port]/derby/derbynet</codeblock>
<note othertype="Notes" type="other">
<ul><li>A servlet engine is not part of the Network Server.</li>
<li>When the Network Server is started by the servlet interface, shutting down
the Application Server also shuts the Network Server down, since both run in the
same JVM.</li></ul></note>
<p>The servlet takes the following optional configuration parameters:</p>
<dl><dlentry>
<dt>host</dt>
<dd>Specifies the host name to be used by the Network Server.
See the Security Considerations section below.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>portNumber</dt>
<dd>Specifies the port number to be used by the Network Server.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>startNetworkServerOnInit</dt>
<dd>Specifies that the Network Server is to be started when the servlet is
initialized.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>tracingDirectory</dt>
<dd>Specifies the location for trace files. If the tracing directory is not
specified, the traces are placed in <codeph>derby.system.home</codeph>.</dd>
</dlentry></dl>
<section><title>Security considerations</title>
<p>For general security considerations for the Network Server, see the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citsec"></ph>.</p>
<p>The <codeph>host</codeph> parameter allows configuration of the host name
that will be used for the listening socket for network connections. By default,
the Network Server will listen to requests only on the loopback address, which
means that it will only accept connections from the local host. Changing this
value could expose the server to external connections, which raises security
concerns, so before using the <codeph>host</codeph> parameter, you should run
under the Java security manager and enable user authentication.</p>
<p>This section describes the servlet pages.</p>
