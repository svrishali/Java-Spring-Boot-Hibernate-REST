<title>Differences between the embedded client and the network client driver</title>
<shortdesc>The following are known differences that exist between the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> embedded driver and the
network client driver.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Network client driver<indexterm>differences with embedded
driver</indexterm></indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>There may be undocumented differences that have not yet been identified. Some
differences with the network client may be changed in future releases to match
the embedded driver functionality.
<ul>
<li>Error messages and <codeph>SQLState</codeph>s can differ between the network
client and embedded driver.</li>
<li>Treatment of error situations encountered during batch processing with
<codeph>java.sql.Statement</codeph>,
<codeph>java.sql.PreparedStatement</codeph>, and
<codeph>java.sql.CallableStatement</codeph> is different. With the embedded
driver, processing stops when an error is encountered; with the network client
driver, processing continues, but an appropriate value as defined in the
<codeph>java.sql.Statement</codeph> API is returned in the resulting update
count array.</li>
<li>To use an encrypted user id and password, you need to have the IBM's Java
Cryptography Extension (JCE) Version 1.2.1 or later.</li>
</ul></p>
