<title>Running the SimpleNetworkClientSample program</title>
<shortdesc>To connect to the Network Server that has been started with the
<codeph>SimpleNetworkServerSample</codeph> program, follow these
steps.</shortdesc>
<taskbody>
<steps>
<step><cmd>Open a command prompt and change directories to the
<codeph>%<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>%\demo\nserverdemo</codeph>
directory, where
<codeph>%<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>%</codeph>
is the directory where you installed
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</cmd>
</step>
<step><cmd>Set the classpath to include the following jar files:</cmd>
<info><ul>
<li>The current directory (".")</li>
<li><codeph>derbyclient.jar</codeph></li>
</ul></info></step>
<step><cmd>After you set up your environment correctly, run the
<codeph>SimpleNetworkClientSample</codeph> program from the same
directory:</cmd>
<stepxmp>
<codeblock><b>java SimpleNetworkClientSample</b></codeblock>
</stepxmp>
<stepresult>If the program runs successfully, you will receive output similar
to that shown in the following example:
<codeblock>Starting Sample client program
Got a client connection via the DriverManager.
connection from datasource; getDriverName = Apache Derby Network Client JDBC Driver
Got a client connection via a DataSource.
Testing the connection obtained via DriverManager by executing a sample query
number of rows in sys.systables = 23
Testing the connection obtained via a DataSource by executing a sample query
