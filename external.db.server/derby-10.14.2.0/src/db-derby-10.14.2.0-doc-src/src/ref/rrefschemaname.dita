<title>schemaName</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>A <i>schemaName</i> represents a <i>schema</i>. Schemas contain
other dictionary objects, such as tables and indexes. Schemas provide a way
to name a subset of tables and other dictionary objects within a database.</p></section>
<section><p>You can explicitly create or drop a schema. The default user schema
is the <i>APP</i> schema (if no user name is specified at connection time).
You cannot create objects in schemas starting with SYS.</p></section>
<section><p>Thus, you can qualify references to tables with the schema name.
When a <i>schemaName</i> is not specified, the default schema name is implicitly
inserted. System tables are placed in the SYS schema. You must qualify
all references to system tables with the SYS schema identifier. For
more information about system tables, see <xref href="rrefsistabs38369.dita#rrefsistabs38369"></xref>.</p></section>
<section><p>A schema is hierarchically the highest level of dictionary object,
so you cannot qualify a <i>schemaName</i>.</p></section>
