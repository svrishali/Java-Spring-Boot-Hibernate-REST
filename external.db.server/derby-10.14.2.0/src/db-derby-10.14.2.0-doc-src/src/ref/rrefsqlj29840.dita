<section><p>The JOIN operations are among the possible
<i><xref href="rreftableexpression.dita">tableExpression</xref></i>s in a
<xref href="rrefsqlj21583.dita">FROM clause</xref>. (You can also perform a join
between two tables using an explicit equality test in a WHERE clause, such as
<codeph>WHERE t1.col1 = t2.col2</codeph>.)</p></section>
<section><p>The JOIN operations are:</p>  <ul>
<li><xref href="rrefsqlj35034.dita#rrefsqlj35034"></xref>   <p>Specifies a
join between two tables with an explicit join clause.</p></li>
<li><xref href="rrefsqlj18922.dita#rrefsqlj18922"></xref>   <p>Specifies a
join between two tables with an explicit join clause, preserving unmatched
rows from the first table.</p></li>
<li><xref href="rrefsqlj57522.dita#rrefsqlj57522"></xref>   <p>Specifies a
join between two tables with an explicit join clause, preserving unmatched
rows from the second table.</p></li>
<li><xref href="rrefsqljcrossjoin.dita#rrefsqljcrossjoin"></xref> <p> Specifies a
join that produces the Cartesian product of two tables. It has no explicit join
clause.</p></li>
<li><xref href="rrefsqljnaturaljoin.dita#rrefsqljnaturaljoin"></xref>
<p>Specifies an inner or outer join between two tables. It has no
explicit join clause. Instead, one is created implicitly using the
common columns from the two tables.</p></li>
</ul> <p>In all cases, you can specify additional restrictions on one
or both of the tables being joined in outer join clauses or in the <xref href="rrefsqlj33602.dita#rrefsqlj33602">WHERE
clause</xref>.</p> </section>
