security manager if, for some reason, you need to run your application outside
of the Java security protections.</shortdesc>

<note othertype="" type="caution">You incur a severe security risk by opening
up the server to all clients without limiting access via user authentication and
a security policy.</note>
<p>Use the <codeph>-noSecurityManager</codeph> option to force the Network
Server to come up without a security manager. For example:</p>
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start \
-h localhost -noSecurityManager</b></codeblock>
