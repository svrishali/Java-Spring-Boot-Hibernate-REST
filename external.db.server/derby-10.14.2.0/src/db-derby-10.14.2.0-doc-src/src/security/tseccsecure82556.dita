<title>Configuring security in a client/server environment</title>
<shortdesc>This procedure requires a system with multiple databases and some
administrative resources.</shortdesc>

<steps>
<step><cmd>Configure security features as system-level properties.</cmd>
</step>
<step><cmd>Provide administrative-level protection for the
<codeph>derby.properties</codeph> file
and <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases. For
example, you can protect these files and directories with operating system
permissions and firewalls.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Turn on user authentication for your system.  All users must provide
valid user IDs and passwords to access the 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system. Use NATIVE
authentication (or, alternatively, LDAP or a user-defined class).</cmd>
<info><p><note type="important">It is also strongly recommended that production
systems protect network connections with SSL/TLS.</note></p></info>
</step>
<step><cmd>Configure fine-grained user authorization (SQL authorization) for
your databases.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Configure Java security for your environment.</cmd></step>
</steps>
<result><p>The following figure shows some of the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> security mechanisms at
work in a client/server environment. User authentication is performed by
accessing an LDAP directory service. The data in the database is not encrypted
in this trusted environment.</p>
