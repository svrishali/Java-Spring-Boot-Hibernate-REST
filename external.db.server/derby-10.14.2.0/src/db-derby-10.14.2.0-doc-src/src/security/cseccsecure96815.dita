<conbody>
<p>An encryption provider implements the Java cryptography concepts. The Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) for Java SE includes Java Cryptographic Extensions
(JCE, part of the Java Cryptography Architecture) and one or more default
encryption providers. For more information, see the <cite>Java Cryptography
Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide</cite> at <xref format="html"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html"
scope="external"/>.
</p>
<p> The JRE determines the default encryption provider as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The JRE's provider is the default.</li>
<li>If your environment for some reason does not include a provider, it must be
specified.</li>
</ul>
