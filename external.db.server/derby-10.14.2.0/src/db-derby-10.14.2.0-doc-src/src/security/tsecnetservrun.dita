<title>Running the Network Server with a security manager</title>
<shortdesc>If you start the Network Server without specifying a security
manager, the Network Server installs a default Java security manager that
enforces a Basic policy.</shortdesc>

<context>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to customize this policy to fit the security needs of your
application and its runtime environment.</p>
<p>You may also run the Network Server without a security manager, although this
is not recommended.
Without a security manager in place, the Network Server should not
be deployed in such a manner as to allow for connections from untrusted
networks.
A firewall or other security tool should be used in such a scenario.</p>
<p>A firewall or other security tool is also good practice
in addition to running the Network Server with a carefully-written
security policy file.</p>
<p>The default policy is used if you boot the Network Server as your VM's entry
point, using a command like the following:</p>
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start ...</b></codeblock>
<p>Some of your application code may run as procedures and functions that you
have declared using the CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION statements. You
will need to add privileged blocks to your declared procedures and functions if
they perform sensitive operations, such as file and network I/O, classloading,
system property reading, and the like.</p>
<p>The Network Server attempts to install a security manager only if you start
the server as the entry point of your VM. The Network Server will not attempt to
install a security manager if you start the server from your application using
the programmatic API described in "Starting the Network Server from a Java
application" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p>
