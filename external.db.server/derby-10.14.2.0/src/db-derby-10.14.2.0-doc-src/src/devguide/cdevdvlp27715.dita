<title>Booting databases</title>
<shortdesc>The default configuration for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
to <i>boot</i> (or start) a database when an application first makes a connection
to it. When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> boots
a database, it checks to see if recovery needs to be run on the database,
so in some unusual cases booting can take some time.</shortdesc>

</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>You can also configure your system to automatically boot all databases
in the system when it starts up; see "<i>derby.system.bootAll</i>" in the <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>. Because of the time needed
to boot a database, the number of databases in the system directory affects
startup performance if you use that configuration. </p>
<p>Once a database has been booted within a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system,
it remains active until the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
has been shut down or until you shut down the database individually.</p>
<p>When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> boots a database,
a message is added to the log file. The message includes the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> version that the
database was booted with, along with information about the Java version,
the user's working directory, and the location of the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system directory, if
the user specified it using the <i>derby.system.home</i> property. If
<i>derby.system.home</i> was not specified, its value is reported as null, as in
the following example:</p>
