<title>Locale-based collation</title>

supports the ability to define collation rules that are appropriate to a
locale. This is referred to as <i><term>locale-based collation</term></i>.

<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> supports the locales
that the Java programming language supports. In addition, it is possible to
create customized locales. For details, see
<xref href="tdevdvlpcustomcollation.dita#tdevdvlpcustomcollation"></xref>.</p>
<p>You can set the locale of a database when you create the database by
specifying the <i>territory=ll_CC</i> attribute. (See
<xref href="tdevdvlpcollation.dita#tdevdvlpcollation"></xref>
for details.) If you do not specify a locale,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> uses
the default locale of the JVM in which the database is created.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can also specify locale-based collation by using the
<i>collation=collation</i> attribute, and you can specify a particular
collation strength to make the database either case-sensitive or
case-insensitive, or to respect both case and accent in collation. See
<xref href="tdevdvlpcaseinscoll.dita#tdevdvlpcaseinscoll"></xref> for
information on making the database use case-insensensitive searches.</p>
<p>Each JVM can support many locales that are independent of the default locale
for the JVM. Collation support for these additional locales is provided
through the <i>java.text.RuleBasedCollator</i> class and the set
of rules for these locales. Refer to the JVM specification for details
of how these rules are used to provide locale-specific collation.</p>
<p>The locale-based collation in
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> affects
how the CHAR and VARCHAR data types are compared. Specifying locale-based
collation also impacts how the LIKE Boolean operator processes CHAR, VARCHAR,
CLOB, and LONG VARCHAR data.</p>
<p>Locale-based collation adds some extra processing overhead to all
character-based comparison operations.</p>
