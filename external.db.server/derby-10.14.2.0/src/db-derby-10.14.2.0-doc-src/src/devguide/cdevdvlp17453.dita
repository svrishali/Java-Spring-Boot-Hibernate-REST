<title>Derby JDBC database connection URL</title>

<conbody>
<p>The standard way to obtain a <i>Connection</i> object is to call the method
<i>DriverManager.getConnection</i>, which takes a <i>String</i> containing a
connection URL (uniform resource locator). A JDBC connection URL provides a way
of identifying a database. It also allows you to perform a number of high-level
tasks, such as creating a database or shutting down the system.</p>
<p>The following example shows the use of the connection URL:</p>
<codeblock>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:sample");</codeblock>
<p>An application in an embedded environment uses a different connection URL
from that used by applications using the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server in a
client/server environment. See "Accessing the Network Server by using the
network client driver" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>
for more information.</p>
<p>However, all versions of the connection URL (which you can use for tasks
besides connecting to a database) have common features:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can specify the name of the database you want to connect to.</li>
<li>You can specify a number of attributes and values that allow you to
accomplish tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about what you can specify with the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> connection URL, see
<xref href="cdevdvlp34964.dita#cdevdvlp34964"></xref>. For details on the
connection URL syntax, see "Syntax of database connection URLs for applications
with embedded databases" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.
For detailed reference information on connection URL attributes and values, see
"Setting attributes for the database connection URL" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
