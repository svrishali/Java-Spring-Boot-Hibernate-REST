<title>Creating a case-insensitive database</title>
<shortdesc>When you create a database using locale-based collation, the
<i>collation=collation</i> value TERRITORY_BASED uses the default
collation strength for the locale, usually TERTIARY, which will consider
character case significant in searches and comparisons.</shortdesc>

<taskbody>
<context><p>To make the database use case-insensitive searches, specify an
explicit strength lower than TERTIARY with the <i>collation=collation</i>
attribute. The strength name is appended to TERRITORY_BASED with a colon to
separate them.</p>
<p>For example, you could specify the following connection URL:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:SwedishDB;create=true;territory=sv_SE;collation=TERRITORY_BASED:PRIMARY</codeblock>
<p>With strength PRIMARY, the characters 'A' and 'a' will be considered equal,
as well as '&#224;' ('a' with a grave accent). (This behavior is
commonly the default with many other databases.) To make searches
respect differences in accent, use strength SECONDARY.</p>
<p>The exact interpretation of the strength part of the attribute depends upon
the locale.</p>
<p>For more information, see
<xref href="tdevdvlpcollation.dita#tdevdvlpcollation"></xref> and the
documentation of the <i>territory=ll_CC</i> and <i>collation=collation</i>
attributes in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
